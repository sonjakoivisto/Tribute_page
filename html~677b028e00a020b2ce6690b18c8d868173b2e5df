<p>Finnish runner Lasse Virén (1949- ) is the most known for the legendary 10 000 meter run in 1972 München Olympics. He symbolises the Finnish 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sisu"> SISU </a>, 
    loosely translating to strenght or resilience. Virén’s main focus had been on 5 000 meters but in Münich he decided to take part also in 10 000 meters. 
    He fell when colliding with another competitor, Mohammed Gammoud, but got quickly back to his feet and took the leading position. After all, he victoriously
     gained his first Olympic Gold Medal with a fresh World record 27.38. Virén proved to be as tough on 5 000 meters in Münich, taking the brightest 
     medal with Olympic record.</p>
